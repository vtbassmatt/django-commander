# Django Commander

Run Django `manage.py` commands from the web.
This is mainly useful in situations where you can't easily SSH into your host.
For example, if you use [azf-wsgi](https://github.com/vtbassmatt/azf-wsgi) to run Django on Azure Functions.

## Configuration

1. Add `commander` to your `INSTALLED_APPS`.
2. Add `COMMANDER_KEY` to your settings. This should be a reasonably secure key, which you'll use in lieu of real authentication ðŸ˜±
3. `from commander import commander_urls` and add `path('commander/', commander_urls),` to your URLconf.
4. Navigate to `http://yourserver/yourapp/commander/?key={COMMANDER_KEY}`.
5. Do whatever config you need to do.
6. Change `COMMANDER_KEY` explicitly to `None` to disable management ðŸ˜Œ
